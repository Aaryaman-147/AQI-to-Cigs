# AQI to Cigarette Equivalent Calculator
This simple tool calculates the number of cigarettes smoked equivalent to your exposure to the Air Quality Index over a given duration, providing insight into the health risk comparable to smoking.

## Features

- Calculates the equivalent number of cigarettes smoked based on the exposure time
- User Friendly UI
- Shows AQI classification (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.)

## AQI Categories

- **Good (0-50) ðŸŸ¢**: Air quality is considered acceptable, with little to no risk to public health.
- **Satisfactory (51-100) ðŸŸ¡**: Air quality is acceptable, but sensitive individuals might experience mild discomfort.
- **Moderate (101-200) ðŸŸ **: Air quality is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, such as children, the elderly, and people with respiratory or heart conditions.
- **Unhealthy (201-300) ðŸŸ£**: Air quality is considered unhealthy, and all individuals may experience health effects.
- **Hazardous (301 +) âš«**: Air quality is considered hazardous, and all individuals may experience serious health effects.

## How it Works

- The tool takes the AQI value and exposure duration as inputs.
- It then converts AQI to PM2.5 concentration using the EPA formula.
- This tool estimates the cigarette equivalent of air pollution based on the assumption that 22 Âµg/mÂ³ of PM2.5 exposure over 24 hours equals smoking one cigarette.
- Finally, it shows the AQI category based on the output.

## How to Use

- Enter the AQI value in the given input box.
- Input the number of hours exposed.
- Click the "Calculate" button.
